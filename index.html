<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>What is SCD?</h3>
<p>SCD (Scottish Country Dancing) is high-energy enthusiastic set dancing done by groups of people. You and a partner repeat different movements to move through a set of people. It's sociable and very fun! 

<h3>What do you mean by GenderFree?</h3>
<p>A GenderFree dance means that there will be no point where your genders are referenced on the dance floor, and there are no requirements that people of certain genders dance in certain spaces or with certain other genders. The specific language used to refer to different roles are the words "Larks" and "Robins".

<h3>Is the space accessible?</h3>
<p>The venue has one entrance with a ramp. Accessing the bathroom involves going down a few steps or around the outside and in the back door. Scottish dancing is traditionally high-energy but dancers are invited to bring the energy they have to safely have a good time.

<h3>Will this happen regularly? When?</h3>
<p>The current plan is to dance on odd Thursdays --first, third, and fifth when available. The next dances after this will be October 17th and November 7th (we will not be dancing on Halloween)
